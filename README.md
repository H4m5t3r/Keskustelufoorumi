# Chat forum
In this project I have created a chat forum where the user can sign in and send messages. The chat forum is built with Flask and uses bootstrap assets. It can be run both locally and uploaded to the online service Heroku. When the program is run locally it uses SQLite to maintain the databases and in Heroku it uses PostgreSQL.

This project was created as part of the course "Aineopintojen harjoitusty√∂: Tietokantasovellus" at the University of Helsinki.

### Features:
Users will be able to
* [x] create an account and change their password
* [x] sign in
* [x] add, edit and delete messages
* [x] create message categories
* [x] filter messages by their category
* [x] add, edit and delete answers to messages
* [x] delete their own messages
* [x] like or remove their likes from other users' messages
* [x] see what users have liked a message
* [x] get a summary of how many messages each user has written

There is also an administrator account, which in some cases can access more features than a regular user. More information can be found in the [user manual](https://github.com/H4m5t3r/Keskustelufoorumi/blob/master/documentation/User%20manual.md) and the [installation guide](https://github.com/H4m5t3r/Keskustelufoorumi/blob/master/documentation/Installation%20guide.md).
