# User manual
This document will focus on how to use the application. For information related to running it locally on your own computer and setting it up, please refer to the [installation guide](https://github.com/H4m5t3r/Keskustelufoorumi/blob/master/documentation/Installation%20guide.md).

## Base functionality
The chat forum allows users to participate in discussions by writing messages and adding answers to the posted messages.

## Creating an account
In the upper right corner there is a link that says "Create an account". Clicking on this link will take you to the page where you can create an account. Users who have an account and are signed in have access to more features than users who do not.

## Signing in
Once you have created an account you can sign in. You can access the sign in page by clicking the link in the upper right corner that says "Sign in". There you can sign in using your account details. You will also be redirected to this page if you are not signed in and try to access features which are only accessible by users who are. If you are successfully signed in it will say "Signed in as *username*" in the upper right corner.

## The top bar
On the top bar there are 3 buttons: "List messages", "Add a message" and "Add a category". Each of these will be explained below.

### List messages
When the user clicks on the "List messages" button they will be taken to a page where they can see the messages that have been posted on the chat forum. Above the messages there is also a link that will take the user to a page where they can see how many messages each user has written and another that lets the user filter the messages by an existing category.

#### View a message
If the user clicks on a title they will be taken to a view where they can read the message. If the user is signed in they also have the options to like the message and add an answer. The user can also view what users have liked the message by clicking on "View" next to the likes. This option will only appear if the message has been liked by at least one person. If the signed in user is the same as the one who wrote the message they will also have the options to edit or delete the message. When a message is edited it will be displayed. Answers can also be edited or deleted.

### Add a message
This feature requires the user to be signed in. When this button is clicked the user will be taken to a form where they can create a new message and post it on the chat forum. The title has to be between 1 and 20 characters long and the message has to be between 1 and 2000 characters long.

### Add a category
This feature requires the user to be signed in. When this button is clicked the user will be taken to a form where they can create a new message category that will appear as an alternative when writing a message.

## Managing your account
If you are logged in there will be two options: "Logout" and "Change password". The logout options will sign you out from your account and "Change password" will allow you to choose a new password.

## Administrators
As an administrator you have the option to delete a message or answer even if it has not been written by you. You cannot, however, edit other users' messages.
