## Limitations and potential expansions
Features that could be added to improve the user experience:

* Deleting accounts
* Deleting categories
* More validators to make sure users use good passwords

Deleting accounts could be done easily by just deleting all messages and other information related to the account but it would be better to implement a feature that changes the name to "Deleted account" and makes the account go into a sleep state so that no one can access it. This way the posted messages would still remain on the chat forum.
